## Strings

In C, we use: 

```c
char[n]; #to represent a string of characters 		
```

We can use the same notation in C++ as well by including the cstring library. Note that we can also use STD library's implementation of string, which I personally find more convenient. 

```c++
#include<cstring>
#include<string>

char[n] str; 
string str1;
```
