# Graphs Key Concepts

## Basic Terminology

![Graph â€” Isaac Computer Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/api/v2.19.3/api/images/content/computer_science/data_structures_and_algorithms/data_structures/figures/Isaac_Computer_Science_2_Data_Structures_Project_OUTLINE_V6_1_2.png)

* A graph is a set of nodes (aka vertices) connect to each other by edges. There are many types of graphs as listed below:

  * **Weighted graph:** When each edge has some weighting factor associated with it. It can represent the cost, length, etc.
  * **Unweighted graph:** No weight or value attached to the edges of the graphs. 
  * **Directed graphs:** When the edges are represented by arrows that indicate the possible directions of traveral, then we call those as directed graphs. 
  * **Undirected graphs: **When there is no directionality associated with the edges of the graphs, then the resulting graph is called an undirected graph. 

  ## Storing Graphs

  * It is possible to store graphs using two popular methods: 

    * Adjacency List 
    * Adjacency Graph

  * The image below shows different kinds of graphs and the associated adjacency matrices:

* An alternative way to do this is by using adjacency lists as shown in the image below:

* Using the list represenation, it is possible to traverse the list and get all the neighbours of a particular node. This is not possible with a matrix. Matrices also takes a larger amount of memory [O(*v^*2) order] - quadratic. Adjacency list however, takes linear memory, not quadratic - i.e. [O(*v+e*)], where *v* are vertices and e are edges.  
* However, with a matrix, without having to traverse a list, we can check if there is a connection between two nodes. This operation will have O(1) time complexity, and O(n) in case of a list. 
* Adjacancy lists however are easier to create and the operations typically involve checking neighbours more than their connections. Therefore, the adjacancy list represtation will be used throughout this repository. 
* During the actual implementation, adjacency lists are created in a class that contains an array of lists, with each element in the array representing the associations between nodes. We can use the STL's <list> to include doubly linked lists. So each element of the array will be a doubly linked list.
